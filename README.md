# Neural-Network-Tasks
This repository includes 3 Tasks that were done throughout the semester for the Neural Network course.

The first task is a single layer perceptron model with a signum activation function which achieved an accuraccy up to 100%.
The second task is The Adaline Learning algorthim.
The third task is Multi Layer Perceptron with backpropagation with the choice of using the sigmoid or tangent hyperbolic activavtion function, which achieved an accuracy up to 83% with sigmoid.

All tasks include GUI where the user gets the choose the desired number of iterations, whether to use a bias or not, number of neurons and number of layers.
